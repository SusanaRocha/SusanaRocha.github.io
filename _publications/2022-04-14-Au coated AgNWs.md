<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) microscopy is an advanced technique for investigation at the nanoscale because of its excellent properties, such as its label-free functionality, non-invasiveness, and ability to simultaneously provide topographic and chemical information. The probe plays a crucial role in TERS technique performance. Widely used AFM-TERS probes fabricated with metal deposition suffer from relatively low reproductivity as well as limited mapping and storage lifetime. To solve the reproducibility issue, silver nanowire (AgNW)-based TERS probes were developed, which, thanks to the high homogeneity of the liquid-phase synthesis of AgNW, can achieve high TERS performance with excellent probe reproductivity, but still present short lifetime due to probe oxidation. In this work, a simple Au coating method is proposed to overcome the limited lifetime and improve the performance of the AgNW-based TERS probe. For the Au-coating, different [Au]/[Ag] molar ratios were investigated. The TERS performance was evaluated in terms of changes in the enhancement factor (EF) and signal-to-noise ratio through multiple mappings and the storage lifetime in air. The Au-coated AgNWs exhibited higher EF than pristine AgNWs and galvanically replaced AgNWs with no remarkable difference between the two molar ratios tested. However, for longer scanning time and multiple mappings, the probes obtained with low Au concentration showed much longer-term stability and maintained a high EF. Furthermore, the Au-coated AgNW probes were found to possess a longer storage lifetime in air, allowing for long and multiple TERS mappings with one single probe.
