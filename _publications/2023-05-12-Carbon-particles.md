<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
The adverse health effects of ambient carbonaceous particles (CPs) such as carbon black (CB), black carbon (BC), and brown carbon (BrC) are becoming more evident and depend on their composition and emission source. Therefore, identifying and quantifying these particles in biological samples are important to better understand their toxicity. Here, we report the development of a nonlinear optical approach for the identification of CPs such as CB and BrC using imaging conditions compatible with biomedical samples. The unique visible light fingerprint of CB and BrC nanoparticles (NPs) upon illumination with a femtosecond (fs) pulsed laser at 1300 nm excitation wavelength is an effective approach for their identification in their biological context. The emission from spectral features of these CPs was investigated with time-domain fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) to further support their identification. This study is performed for different types of CPs embedded in agarose gel as well as in in vitro mammalian cells. The unique nonlinear emissive behavior of CP NPs used for their label-free identification is further complementary with fluorophores typically used for specific staining of biological samples thus providing the relevant bio-context.
