<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Interactions between epigenetic readers and histone modifications play a pivotal role in gene expression regulation and aberrations can enact etiopathogenic roles in both developmental and acquired disorders like cancer. Typically, epigenetic interactions are studied by mass spectrometry or chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing. However, in these methods, spatial information is completely lost. Here, we devise an expansion microscopy based method, termed Expansion Microscopy for Epigenetics or ExEpi, to preserve spatial information and improve resolution. We calculated relative co-localization ratios for two epigenetic readers, lens epithelium derived growth factor (LEDGF) and bromodomain containing protein 4 (BRD4), with marks for heterochromatin (H3K9me3 and H3K27me3) and euchromatin (H3K36me2, H3K36me3 and H3K9/14ac). ExEpi confirmed their preferred epigenetic interactions, showing co-localization for LEDGF with H3K36me3/me2 and for BRD4 with H3K9/14ac. Moreover addition of JQ1, a known BET-inhibitor, abolished BRD4 interaction with H3K9/14ac with an IC50 of 137 nM, indicating ExEpi could serve as a platform for epigenetic drug discovery. Since ExEpi retains spatial information, the nuclear localization of marks and readers was determined, which is one of the main advantages of ExEpi. The heterochromatin mark, H3K9me3, is located in the nuclear rim whereas LEDGF co-localization with H3K36me3 and BRD4 co-localization with H3K9/14ac occur further inside the nucleus.
