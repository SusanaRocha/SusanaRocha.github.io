<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
The self-organization of colloidal nanoparticles into complex structures, both in equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium, is a critical area in colloidal science with potential applications in creating new functional materials. While equilibrium assemblies yield thermodynamically stable and periodic structures, non-equilibrium (or active) assemblies exhibit dynamic, reconfigurable behavior in response to external stimuli. As a consequence, understanding the structure-function relationships in these assemblies remain challenging due to their transient, highly dynamic nature and the limitations of current characterization methods. In this work, we present a novel methodology for Fixation and Resolution of Colloidal Active Matter Ensembles (FRAME). FRAME combines UV photopolymerization to immobilize non-equilibrium (active) colloidal assembly with high-resolution imaging techniques, such as 3D confocal microscopy and SEM, for subsequent structural characterization. We demonstrate this method on Optical Matter (OM) structure formed by an optical trap at glass/water interface where it enables the preservation and detailed analysis of OM structures, using colloidal nanoparticles ranging from 200 nm to 1 μm. We demonstrate the method's efficacy by validating that the immobilization process does not alter the structural properties, allowing for accurate structural analysis. Additionally, this approach enables the capture of dynamic snapshots of the assembly during its formation, providing critical insights into its transient behavior. FRAME offers a new avenue for investigating non-equilibrium colloidal assemblies, paving the way for their rational design and application across a broad range of colloidal systems.
