<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Nanoparticle-mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) shows promise as a standalone cancer treatment but faces clinical challenges due to inconsistent efficacy. Its translation is further hindered by a limited understanding of plasmon-induced heat effects, such as stress responses and intercellular signaling. Here, we investigate how plasmon-induced local heating affects cellular behavior and fate within tumor spheroids by focusing on the activity of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Spheroids were prepared from HeLa cells that express a FRET-based ERK sensor, and ERK activity changes under photothermal stimuli were tracked using a deep-learning program, 3DeeCellTracker. Gold nanostars were used as highly efficient photothermal transducers. Our results revealed significant alterations in ERK signaling patterns upon photothermal stimulation compared to spontaneous ERK activity in untreated spheroids, including changes in the activation frequency, timing, and duration. Notably, photothermal-induced ERK activity propagated across neighboring cells within the spheroid, suggesting intercellular communication. Furthermore, analysis of cell death and division further demonstrated that laser power modulates cellular fate during photothermal therapy. This study provides insights for predicting the therapeutic effects of PPT and guides the rational design of next-generation photothermal strategies. Additionally, our approach demonstrates the potential of FRET-based biosensors and deep-learning tools as powerful methods to study the effects of various therapeutic stimuli on solid tumors at the single-cell level.
