<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Nature uses discrete molecular building blocks to form polymers that assemble into multicomponent, multi-dynamic networks, inside (cytoskeleton) and outside (extracellular matrix) the cell. Both the intra-fibrous molecular dynamics and interactions between fibers dictate (non)linear mechanics, such as stress stiffening and relaxation, and ultimately biological function. Current synthetic systems capture only one dynamic process. Here, we present multi-dynamic hydrogels by uniting a stress-stiffening polymer with supramolecular polymers. Crucial is the molecular dynamics of the supramolecular polymers: They dictate the interaction strength with the stress-stiffening polymer and the subsequent dynamic mechanical properties of the mixed networks. The biological relevance of our multi-dynamic hydrogels is demonstrated by their ability to support fibroblast cell spreading. Future work may address the display of various dynamically presented bioactive cues to cells.
