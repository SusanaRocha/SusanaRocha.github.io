<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Understanding the dynamics and distribution of medicinal drugs in living cells is essential for the design and discovery of treatments. The tools available for revealing this information are, however, extremely limited. Here, we report the application of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) endoscopy, using plasmonic nanowires as SERS probes, to monitor the intracellular fate and dynamics of a common chemo-drug, doxorubicin, in A549 cancer cells. The unique spatio-temporal resolution of this technique reveals unprecedented information on the mode of action of doxorubicin: its localization in the nucleus, its complexation with medium components, and its intercalation with DNA as a function of time. Notably, we were able to discriminate these factors for the direct administration of doxorubicin or the use of a doxorubicin delivery system. The results reported here show that SERS endoscopy may have an important future role in medicinal chemistry for studying the dynamics and mechanism of action of drugs in cells.
