Congratulations are in order for **Dr. Laskaratou**!
After successfully publishing a nice article in Nature Communications (see the publication <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22816-7"><u>here</u></a>.), Danai successfully defended her PhD thesis.
Luckly, the current regulations allowed a hybrid defence, and Danai could present her research to the jury members, friends and family. Her explanation of fluorescence, FRET and cell signalling in layman's terms was superb!
<br><br>
<i>Danai also wrote a nice 'behind the paper' contribution, which you can read <a href="https://devicematerialscommunity.nature.com/posts/dim-fluorescent-proteins-shine-light-on-acceptor-anisotropy5"><u>here</u></a>.
