Congratulations **Hongbo**, and all the other authors! This was truly a team effort, only possible in collaboration with  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Paul-H-J-Kouwer-Lab"><u>Paul Kouwer</u></a>'s group, and with the support of the <a href="https://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/bme/research/mechbio"><u>Matrix group</u></a>.
<br>Several years later, we were finally able to perform TFM in PIC gels - and learn a lot from it!
