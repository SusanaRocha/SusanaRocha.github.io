We are organising a summer school to teach early stage researchers how to use fluorescence microscopy to investigate cellular forces.
A mix of lectures, tutorials & hands-on workshops. Organised in collaboration with the group of Prof. Van Oosterwyck (KULeuven) and with the support of Arenberg Doctoral School and PicoQuant.
