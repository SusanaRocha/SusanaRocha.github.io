What started as a collaboration between two groups, developed into to a friendship and the desire to organize something together. I don't remember the details, but the idea probably came during our 'Friday afternoon drinks'. From 'That is a nice idea' to 'we should definetily do it', here we are, a couple of months later, on the after-match of a very nice event.<br>
With invited experts, in FRET (Jelle) and mechanical properties of soft materials (Paul), this school was set to succeed. <br>
We did not knew what to expected, but were super happy with the adhesion. A very heterogeneous group of young researchers, eager to learn. We hope that this event has contributed to the development of their career - and that they stay in the bright side of the force!
<br>
We will repeat it? Sure! As long as we can have fun organising it :)
