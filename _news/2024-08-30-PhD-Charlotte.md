ðŸŽ‰ Huge congratulations to **Charlotte Cresens** for very successfully defending her PhD ðŸŽ“ I am incredibly proud of seeing Charlotte achieve this incredible milestone, though it's bittersweet knowing she won't be in our lab anymore. ðŸ¥¹ <br>
But, as she embarks on her next journey as a super-resolution microscopy expert at the VIB imaging core in Leuven, I'm certain our paths will cross again. ðŸ¥³ Best of luck, Charlotte, in your future career â€” you will do amazing things!
