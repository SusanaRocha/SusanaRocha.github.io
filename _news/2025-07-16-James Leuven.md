A rare gathering in Leuven…<br>
For the first time, we brought together both generations of PhD students from our <b>Global PhD partnership between KU Leuven and University of Melbourne</b>:<br>
* Maria Bravo & Samantha Zaman, now wrapping up their PhDs on nanoparticles for light-mediated cancer therapy<br>
* Yana Heyvaert & Naomi Suniva Ariki Duggan, just starting their journey on nano-enhanced hydrogels to study mechanotransduction<br><br>
This collaboration started over five years ago as a shared vision between Prof. Hiroshi Ujii, Prof. Johan Hofkens, Dr. Beatrice Fortuni, Prof. Paul Mulvaney, Dr. James Hutchison, and myself. It grew out of longstanding scientific connections — including James’ postdoc in Leuven during my own PhD — and evolved into two successful Global PhD Partnership projects.<br>
Last Thursday, the stars aligned: two PhD pairs (finishing & starting) and both main promotors (James and myself) in one room. A rare milestone — and one that made us feel proud and excited for what’s ahead.
