Congratulations <b>Johannes</b>! For the PhD and for the amazing presentation you gave <b>in Dutch!</b>
<br>
We were left with mix feelings of being proud and happy for you, and a bit sadness for letting you go 'across the fence', to the industry. I am 100% sure you will succeed in whatever you set your mind into. You were without a doubt one of the most hard working students, <i>even if the work was not always related to science </i>;)
