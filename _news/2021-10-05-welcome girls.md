With the start of the academic year, I would like to welcome the new students that joined the group: <a href="{{site.github.url}}/team/Silke"><span style="color:gray">Silke</span></a>, <a href="{{site.github.url}}/team/MariaBravo"><span style="color:gray">Maria</span></a>, <a href="{{site.github.url}}/team/astha"><span style="color:gray">Astha</span></a> and <a href="{{site.github.url}}/team/sarah"><span style="color:gray">Sarah</span></a>! <br>
(Also a late welcome to <a href="{{site.github.url}}/team/AnaCunha"><span style="color:gray">Ana</span></a>, who arrived already in the beginning of the year)<br><br>
