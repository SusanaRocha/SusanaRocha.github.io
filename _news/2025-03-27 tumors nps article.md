What if tweaking nanoparticles isn’t enough to improve nanomedicine? 🧐
In our latest work, we show that tumor biology – not just particle design – affects how nanoparticles behave.
Same particles. Different tumors. Totally different outcomes. 🤯
Big shoutout to **Maria Bravo, Guillermo Solís, Beatrice Fortuni** and all co-authors for pushing this forward!
