**Johannes** included on his PhD thesis a chapter on 'all you need to know about PIC', so that the lab members joining after him could quickly gather the most important information. With additional support of **Max** (Khaizeng Liu) and **Roel**, we manage to publish this work. We believe the material community will greatly benefit from this review. <br> The full publication can be found in the <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(24)00059-6"><u>journal</u></a>.
