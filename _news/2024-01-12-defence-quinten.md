Congratulations to **Quinten** for defending his PhD! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ“ There was fluorescence imaging, some curve fitting, strange equations but above all, a lot of fun! You leave a legacy behind: a new research line on FRET-based tension sensors and, more important, coffee mugs for the group ðŸ˜‰ Enjoy your return to the motherland of West Flanders and keep in touch!
