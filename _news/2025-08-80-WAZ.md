Taking part in <b>Wetenschap aan Zee 2025</b> was a wonderful opportunity to bring our research out of the lab and into the public sphere. I had the pleasure — and the challenge — of presenting our work on nanotechnology and mini-tumors to a general audience, entirely in Dutch. Many thanks to the organizers, and in particular to <b>Prof. Steven De Feyter</b>, for the invitation. It was equally inspiring to share the stage with <b>Prof. Maarten Roeffaers</b>, whose talk on detecting microplastics with light offered a fascinating look at science in action. Events like this remind us of the value of science outreach — sparking curiosity, encouraging dialogue, and making complex ideas accessible to everyone.
