How do cells translate molecular forces into mechanical actions? ðŸ§¬ðŸ”¬ðŸ’ª <br>
Our new research combines **Traction Force Microscopy (TFM)** with **FRET-based tension sensors** to uncover how focal adhesions manage vinculin tension and cellular traction. Our findings highlight the dynamic interplay between molecular-scale tension and large-scale cellular mechanics.<br>
