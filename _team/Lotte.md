Cancer progression and metastasis are strongly influenced by the tumor microenvironment, which involves intricate interactions between cancer cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the extracellular matrix (ECM), and immune cells. Advanced 3D models are critical for understanding these processes, as traditional 2D culture methods and animal models often lack the accuracy and reproducibility needed for personalized, clinically relevant studies.

<i>Project Aim</i><br>
This project focuses on developing a biomimetic 3D model using an adaptable polyisocyanide (PIC) hydrogel, providing a controlled and reproducible platform to study tumor-immune interactions. In collaboration with Prof. Ilaria Elia’s research group (Laboratory of Metabolic Regulation of Cell Function), this model will enable:<br>
*	Introducing and optimizing immune cells within the 3D microenvironment (our team's focus).<br>
*	Investigating and modulating the metabolic properties and responses of immune cells (Prof. Elia’s team’s focus).<br>
To model tumor dynamics, the project uses melanoma cells, a type of skin cancer arising from pigment-producing melanocytes. The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) plays a pivotal role in regulating melanoma cell invasion. Low or absent MITF expression is characteristic of invasive melanoma cells, while high MITF expression is associated with non-invasive cells.
