The high morbidity and mortality rates associated with cancer are mainly caused by cancer metastasis: a multistep-process whereby cancer cells adapt, break free from the primary tumor site and migrate to colonize tissues in distant organs like the liver or lungs. During the process, metastatic cells go through detachment, migration, invasion and adhesion. These four essential steps are interrelated and are influenced by everything in the near vicinity of the cell. This so-called cellular microenvironment mainly consists of other cells (of the same or a different cell type) and the extracellular matrix (ECM), a 3D fibrous network of extracellular macromolecules that structurally and biochemically supports the cell.
Cell-ECM interactions are mediated through cellular adhesion complexes. These protein complexes contain various dedicated molecules and physically link the cellular cytoskeleton to the ECM, anchoring the cell to its environment. The dynamic nature of cellular adhesion complexes involves a continuous assembly, disassembly, internalization and recycling of adhesion proteins. These processes are governed by vesicle trafficking. While previous reports have shown that vesicle trafficking is upregulated in cells with a higher metastatic potential, it is still not known how this affects the migration of cancer cells and, consequently, cancer metastasis. The influence of the mechanical properties of the microenvironment on the organization of cellular adhesion complexes will be investigated using cutting edge fluorescence microscopy methods (including superâ€‘resolution fluorescence microscopy).
