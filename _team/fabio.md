In the last years many biomaterials have been designed to mimic the structural and biochemical functions of the natural extracellular matrix. While natural polymeric materials are more easily accepted by biological systems, the limited availability, potential immunogenicity and structural complexity restrict their use. In this sense, synthetic polymers have several advantages when utilized as scaffolds: they are reproducible and have tunable biochemical and physical properties.

However, most of the synthetic materials lack some of the properties of natural gels, namely the fibrillary architecture and non-linear elastic behavior. Recently, a fully synthetic material has been developed that mimic biological gels, like fibrin and collagen, in nearly all aspects, particularly the fibrous architecture and the strong nonlinear mechanical response at low stresses. This biomimetic gel is prepared from poly-iso-cyanides functionalized with oligo-ethylene glycol side chains (PIC-gels). As a synthetic material, its properties are readily manipulated by changing concentration, polymer length, functional groups, and temperature.

The first aim of this project is to investigate how external mechanical stimuli will affect the network architecture of PIC-gels, at the micrometer scale. The structural characterization of the biomimetic network will be done using fluorescence microscopy and 3D processing algorithms. For the mechanical stimuli, we will use a nanoindentor or a microfluidic device. The second aim of this project is to monitor how mechanical stimuli, transmitted through the hydrogel network, affect cellular behaviour. Amongst others, we will investigate the calcium signaling pathways, and the formation of focal adhesion using fluorescence-based protein sensors.

Our results and techniques give more insights in the interplay between external mechanical stimuli, properties of synthetic scaffolds and cell behaviour. This knowledge is a crucial step in a development of the next generation biomimetic materials for 3D in vivo models and tissue engineering.
