Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most commonly diagnosed cancers worldwide. Through advanced proteomic analyses of CRC cells with varying metastatic capacities, we identified several proteins showing changes in expression levels or intracellular localization. One protein of particular interest is BAIAP2, known as the brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor (BAI1)-binding protein. This protein's interaction with the cytoplasmic membrane plays a critical role in its functions, including potential involvement in neuronal growth-cone guidance.

In our previous studies, we observed that highly metastatic CRC cells exhibit increased levels of BAIAP2 at the cell membrane. Moreover, analysis of patient samples revealed a significant correlation between elevated BAIAP2 levels at the membrane and poorer clinical outcomes.<br><br>

<i>Project Objectives</i><br>
This project aims to design and develop DNA origami nanostructures as advanced delivery platforms for siRNA in cancer therapy. The primary goals include:
•	Engineering a stable, biocompatible DNA origami platform capable of encapsulating siRNA.
•	Optimizing siRNA delivery to cancer cells and assessing its release and gene-silencing efficacy.
•	Exploring functionalization strategies to enhance targeting specificity using ligands like antibodies or aptamers.
