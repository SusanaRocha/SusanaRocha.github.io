Despite numerous advances in treatment approaches, cancer remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, as the existing methods (surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy) bear many complications. Consequently, the urge to develop more effective therapies gave rise to intensive research in delivery of chemotherapeutics with engineered nanoparticles (NPs) as drug delivery systems (DDSs). Over the years, significant breakthroughs using NP based drug DDSs have been achieved in the nanomedicin field. However, one of the biggest problems in nanomedicin is that the overall majority of DDS research is carried out on 2D monolayer cell cultures.  As a solid tumor in the human body is a 3D structure surrounded by a dense and complex extracellular matrix (ECM), 2D monolayer cell cultures do not present a good model to test DDSs. Furthermore, a study in mice revealed that only 14 in 1 million nanoparticles injected actually reach the tumor cells.This alarming number is due to the tumor ECM and the dense 3D assembly of cancer cells, two physical barriers that limit the passage of nanoparticles.  Therefore, more advanced 3D models to test and investigate the behaviour of DDSs are required. An example of such a model are multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTSs). Spheroids are cancer cells which aggregate into a solid 3D tumor-like assembly (figure). They recapitulate key characteristics of an actual human tumor but on a smaller scale (diameter smaller than 1mm), making the model highly suitable for investigating the NP behaviour in the spheroid using fluorescence microscopy. Using these more advanced models (that mimic the tumor and its environment) researchers can obtain more detailed information on important aspects in drug delivery. For instance, the penetration of DDSs in solid tumors towards the centre, which is key in the efficiency of DDSs.
