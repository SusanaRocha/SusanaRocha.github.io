Cellular communication proceeds at different levels: chemically through a wide variety of cytokines, and physically, through cell-cell interactions and through interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM) that surrounds the cells. By pushing and pulling the ECM, cells continuously sense the dynamic mechanical cues from their microenvironment and generate physical feedback.
At the molecular level, cells sense and transmit forces with the matrix through the so-called focal adhesion complexes that link the ECM to the cellular cytoskeleton. The amplitude of the applied cellular forces, and their propagation through the ECM, depends on both the biochemical and the mechanical properties of the matrix. Taking advantage of a unique synthetic material, and advanced microscopy-based methods, we can perform a systematic study of the influence of the matrix on cellular forces.
 In this project, the student will use fluorescence microscopy and molecular force sensors to quantify cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions. This will require the use of FRET-based sensors (protein or DNA), microfluidics and biomimetic hydrogels.
