Supramolecular hydrogels have gained a tremendous amount of attention throughout the last decade due to their potential in a variety of biomedical applications. For instance, their responsive and porous self-assembled fibrillary network makes them an adequate synthetic alternative to the natural extracellular matrix (ECM). In other words, supramolecular gels can provide a structure on which cells can grow. Providing cells with such a scaffold is a crucial aspect for cell proliferation, which enables the artificial growth of functioning tissues. Unfortunately, the adhesion mechanism of cells to the ECM and the corresponding cell-matrix interactions are often poorly understood.

 The aim of this thesis is twofold. First, a number of previously developed supramolecular hydrogels will be tested as potential tissue engineering scaffolds for different cell lines using confocal microscopy. Second, novel supramolecular hydrogels with fluorescent characteristics will be developed through advanced synthetic strategies. The discovery of a fluorescent supramolecular hydrogel will allow us to image the changes in the structure of the scaffold, induced by cellular forces, and track the cell adhesion mechanism through state-of-the-art fluorescence microscopy techniques. This will provide us with valuable insights concerning the cell-matrix interactions.
