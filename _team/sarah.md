Cellular communication proceeds at different levels: chemically through a wide variety of cytokines, and physically, through cell-cell interactions and through interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM) that surrounds the cells. By pushing and pulling the ECM, cells continuously sense the dynamic mechanical cues from their microenvironment and generate physical feedback.

At the molecular level, cells sense and transmit forces with the matrix through the so-called focal adhesion complexes that link the ECM to the cellular cytoskeleton. These complexes are composed of integrin (a transmembrane receptor) and many other protein complexes, classified into two major groups: catalytic proteins and adaptor proteins. The catalytic proteins are involved in the focal adhesions' turnover and include kinases (e.g., FAK) and proteases (e.g., calpain). Previous results suggest that the mechanical properties of the ECM regulate the activity of FAK and calpain through calcium signaling pathways. Furthermore, it has been shown that Ca2+ mobilization is regulated by mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs) and is involved in myosin-mediated contractile forces along the actin cytoskeleton. We hypothesized that external mechanical stimuli will activate mechanosensitive ion channels, inducing (local) changes in Ca2+ concentration, which will regulate the activity of FAK and calpain, and consequently alter the cellular forces applied to the ECM.
