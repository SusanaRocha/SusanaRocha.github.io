Colorectal cancer is Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major health problem in developed countries. Patients are mainly diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease where they present metastatic wounds, metastasis is the migration of tumoral cells from their original niche to colonize other tissues, and the survival rate is very low. Prevention and early diagnosis are pivotal tools in fighting against this disease. Proteomics, the study of the differential expression of proteins in different cells, has provided with many diagnostic markers as it can identify proteins that are specifically expressed by cancer cells compared with normal cells, and also between metastatic and nonmetastatic variants of a same tumor. Our project aims to investigate the relation between some of the identified markers and the appearance of metastasis, as well to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the induction of metastasis so that a possible therapeutical target can be found. To do so, we will also develop a new microscopy technique that will allow for mapping the interactions of the altered proteins. For this project, we will mainly focus in the study of the metastasis towards liver that some forms of colorectal cancers have shown. Nevertheless, as part of this project we will also extend the proteomic characterization of the metastasis to lymph nodes to try to find new early diagnostic markers and a possible cause behind the onset of metastasis.
